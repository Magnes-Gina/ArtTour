# ArtTour Project Description

“Art Tour”, is an iOS application which provides users with a map of landmarks and public artworks and image recognition that allows them to obtain information about landmark and public artwork easily. Also, the app provides a list of events related to arts and culture, and a little game that shows the numbers of landmark and public artwork visited by the user. The game allows users to share or compete with others.
By providing above functions, Art Tour aims to increase public awareness and understanding of landmarks and public artwork, encourage public to participate into art events and in the end, change Melbourne to a more creative city.
Our users can be residents or visitors who are interested in art and culture, and are exploring or plan to explore the creative life of Melbourne.

We can help when:

•	Users want to know if there is any landmark or artwork closed by to visit but they do not have time or are not willing to spend time to investigate;

•	Users find a beautiful artwork/landmark, and want to know its name and related information, but they do not have time or are not willing to spend time to search online;                                                                                                                                                  

•	Users want to know the ongoing and upcoming art event. And add interested events to the calendar.
